## ✅ Multi-Drone Profile System - Completed

### Overview
**Status:** 100% Complete ✅
**Branch:** `feature/drone-profiles`
**PR #1:** https://github.com/eddycek/beta-pidtune/pull/1 - Ready for Review ✅

Complete multi-drone profile system allowing users to manage multiple drones with:
- Unique identification via FC serial number (MSP_UID)
- 10 preset profiles (tiny-whoop, micro-whoop, 5" freestyle, 7" long range, etc.)
- Custom profile creation with smart defaults (1S-6S batteries, 1"-10" drone sizes)
- Profile-specific snapshot tracking with server-side filtering
- Auto-detection of known/new drones on connection
- Profile locking when FC is connected (prevents accidental switching)
- Comprehensive UI testing (128 tests) with pre-commit hooks
- Full documentation (CLAUDE.md, TESTING.md)

### Task #13: Backend Implementation ✅
**Status:** Completed

#### 13.1 TypeScript Types ✅
- ✅ Profile types (DroneProfile, DroneProfileMetadata, ProfileCreationInput, etc.)
- ✅ Preset profile definitions (6 common drone configurations)
- ✅ Size-based defaults (weight, motor KV, battery, prop size)
- ✅ Optional advanced fields (frame type, flight style, stiffness)

#### 13.2 Storage Layer ✅
- ✅ ProfileStorage: File-based JSON storage
- ✅ ProfileManager: Business logic and validation
- ✅ Profile CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- ✅ Profile-snapshot linking
- ✅ Export/import functionality

#### 13.3 MSP Integration ✅
- ✅ FC serial number retrieval via MSP_UID command
- ✅ UID parsing (12-byte to hex string)
- ✅ Auto-detection on connection
- ✅ Profile matching by serial number

#### 13.4 IPC Layer ✅
- ✅ 10 new IPC channels for profile operations
- ✅ Event channels (profile-changed, new-fc-detected)
- ✅ Handler implementations with error handling
- ✅ Preload script API exposure

#### 13.5 SnapshotManager Integration ✅
- ✅ Snapshots linked to profiles automatically
- ✅ Filter snapshots by current profile
- ✅ Profile-specific baseline snapshots
- ✅ Delete protection for baseline snapshots

### Task #14: UI Implementation ✅
**Status:** Completed

#### 14.1 ProfileWizard Component ✅
- ✅ Multi-step wizard (5 steps)
- ✅ Method selection (preset vs custom)
- ✅ Preset selector with 6 preset profiles
- ✅ Custom configuration (basic + advanced)
- ✅ Smart defaults based on drone size
- ✅ Review step before creation
- ✅ Modal design with backdrop
- ✅ Auto-show on new FC detection

#### 14.2 Profile Management UI ✅
- ✅ ProfileSelector: Collapsible dropdown with all profiles
- ✅ ProfileCard: Individual profile display with metadata
- ✅ Active profile indicator
- ✅ Recent connection indicator
- ✅ Delete and export actions
- ✅ Relative time formatting
- ✅ useProfiles hook for state management

#### 14.3 Integration ✅
- ✅ Integrated into main App.tsx
- ✅ Event listeners for profile changes
- ✅ Auto-show wizard on new FC
- ✅ Profile selector in main layout

### Features Implemented
- ✅ 10 preset profiles (tiny-whoop, micro-whoop, toothpick, freestyle, race, cinematic, long-range, etc.)
- ✅ Battery support: 1S, 2S, 3S, 4S, 6S
- ✅ Drone sizes: 1", 2", 2.5", 3", 4", 5", 6", 7", 10"
- ✅ Smart defaults: changing size auto-fills weight, motor KV, battery, prop size
- ✅ Profile editing: Full edit modal with all fields editable
- ✅ Profile deletion: Confirmation modal with warnings, deletes all associated snapshots
- ✅ Profile locking: Cannot switch profiles when FC is connected (UI lock with visual indicator)
- ✅ Profile-specific snapshots: Server-side filtering by profile.snapshotIds array
- ✅ Auto-detection: Known drones auto-load profile, new drones show wizard (cannot be cancelled)
- ✅ Connection tracking: Last connected timestamp, connection count
- ✅ Baseline snapshots: Auto-created on first connection
- ✅ Board name handling: Null byte filtering, fallback to target name
- ✅ Connection reliability: 3-second cooldown, auto port detection, retry logic

### Bug Fixes (8 Critical Issues Resolved)
- ✅ **Profile deletion blocked**: Removed active profile check, auto-clear currentProfileId
- ✅ **Orphaned snapshots**: Delete all profile snapshots on profile deletion
- ✅ **App crash on preset**: Added missing PRESET_PROFILES import
- ✅ **"FC not responding" on immediate reconnect**: Added 3s cooldown + 1s backend delay
- ✅ **Baseline not auto-created**: Create baseline after profile creation
- ✅ **Port error on FC change**: Auto-detect port changes, select first available
- ✅ **Wrong snapshots visible**: Server-side filtering by currentProfile.snapshotIds
- ✅ **Empty board name**: Filter null bytes, fallback to target, conditional display

## 📝 Notes and Ideas

### Ideas for Task #11:
```typescript
// Possible ReconnectionManager structure
class ReconnectionManager {
  private maxRetries = 5;
  private baseDelay = 1000; // 1 second

  async attemptReconnection(port: string): Promise<boolean> {
    // Exponential backoff retry logic
  }

  onDisconnected(callback: () => void): void {
    // Event listener
  }
}
```

### Potential Issues:
- Serial port may be locked by another process
- FC may restart during save-and-reboot
- Multiple FCs connected simultaneously
- USB hub compatibility

### Test Scenarios:
1. Normal connect/disconnect
2. FC reboot after "save" command
3. Sudden USB cable removal
4. Multiple connection attempts
5. FC crashed (bootloop)

- [ ] Noise spectrum visualization
- [ ] PID step response analysis
- [ ] Guided tuning wizard
- [ ] AI-powered tuning recommendations
