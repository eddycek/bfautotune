/**
 * Filter group delay estimator.
 *
 * Computes the approximate group delay (phase delay) of Betaflight's
 * gyro and D-term filter chains. Group delay directly impacts PID
 * response latency — excessive delay causes sluggish response and
 * can create instability through phase lag.
 *
 * BF filter stack:
 * - Gyro path: LPF1 (PT1/biquad) → LPF2 (PT1/biquad) → dynamic notch(es)
 * - D-term path: LPF1 (PT1/biquad) → LPF2 (PT1/biquad)
 *
 * Group delay for a first-order PT1 lowpass at frequency f:
 *   τ(f) = 1 / (2π * fc * (1 + (f/fc)²))
 *
 * Group delay for a second-order biquad lowpass (Q≈0.707) at frequency f:
 *   τ(f) ≈ (2 * fc) / (2π * ((fc² - f²)² + (f * fc / Q)²)) * (fc² + f²)
 *   Simplified at low frequencies (f << fc): τ ≈ Q / (π * fc)
 *
 * For practical drone tuning, we compute group delay at a reference
 * frequency (default: 80 Hz, typical control bandwidth) and sum the
 * chain. This gives pilots actionable latency numbers.
